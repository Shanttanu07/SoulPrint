# SoulPrint: A Digital Avatar Solution

The inevitability of mortality is a profound truth. However, in our digitally advanced age, we offer solace to this inevitability.

## Description

**SoulPrint** is a state-of-the-art, AI-driven solution allowing individuals, especially the terminally ill, to create a digital avatar of themselves. This avatar can interact with loved ones long after the individual's departure, providing both comfort for the grieving and assurance for the departing.

## Technical Terms and Libraries Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilized for text-based interactions with avatars.
- **Speech Recognition**: Advanced speech recognition techniques to convert audio into text.
- **Emotional Analysis**: Classification of audio into diverse moods, including happy, sad, worried, excited, angry, love, and neutral.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Used for audio classification.
- **Voice Cloning**: The **11Clouds API** is employed to replicate an individual's voice.
- **Video Analysis**: Emotion detection in videos and video categorization.
- **LLM (Language Model)**: A model combining features from Langchain and ChatGPT 3.5 for simulating conversation.

## Detailed Implementation

### Video Recording & Speech Extraction

- **Objective**: Collect comprehensive data of the individual to replicate their essence.
- **Process**: Video recordings of the subject are undertaken. The embedded speech in these recordings is converted to text using advanced speech recognition techniques.

### Emotional Analysis Module

- **Objective**: Understand and classify the myriad emotions present in the recorded audios.
- **Process**: Using **SVM**, the module classifies audio into diverse moods, namely happy, sad, worried, excited, angry, love, neutral, and more. These mood-specific audios are grouped together, creating mood conglomerate audios.

### Voice Cloning

- **Objective**: Replicate the individual's voice to provide authentic responses in the digital avatar.
- **Process**: The **11Clouds API** is employed to clone the subject's voice. This cloned voice is then mapped to the categorized mood audios, creating a database of mood-specific voice responses.

### Video Extraction Module

- **Objective**: Use the emotional undertones in the video to categorize them.
- **Process**: The previously discussed emotional analysis model also works on the video data. Videos are subsequently classified based on their predominant emotion. A structured JSON file is created, enlisting videos according to their emotional content.

### LLM Model Training

- **Objective**: Train a model that can simulate the subject's manner of speaking and thinking.
- **Process**: The text data extracted is the foundation for the training of the LLM model. Incorporating features from Langchain and ChatGPT 3.5, this model, once trained, mirrors the subject's personality and emotional dynamics.

### Prediction and Generation

- **Objective**: Generate realistic and emotionally congruent interactions.
- **Process**: Upon receiving a prompt, the LLM model produces a response. The emotional analysis module gauges the mood of this response. Using the previously categorized audios and videos, a voice clone with the corresponding mood and a matched emotional video are selected. The Wav2Lip tool then integrates these, creating a deepfake interaction.

## Potential Impact

### For the Living

An unprecedented avenue to interact, reminisce, and find comfort.

### For the Departing

Assurance that a part of them will provide solace and memories, minimizing the existential fear of being forgotten.

## Beyond Memories: More Applications

The revolutionary nature of the **SoulPrint** project isn't just about preserving a person's essence. Its potential applications expand far beyond posthumous interactions:

### Alzheimer's Patients

- **Objective**: Aid memory recall and emotional connection for Alzheimer's patients.
- **Process**: Alzheimer's patients can interact with their digital avatars, capturing their essence from earlier, memory-rich periods of their lives. This interaction can stimulate the patient's cognitive faculties, potentially triggering forgotten memories and rekindling emotional bonds.

### Nurturing Parent-Child Relationships

- **Objective**: Preserve parental guidance and support for future generations.
- **Process**: Parents can use **SoulPrint** to record messages, advice, and life lessons for their children. These recorded interactions can be accessed by the children at various milestones of their lives, ensuring that the parental bond remains strong, even if physical presence isn't possible.
